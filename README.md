This is a simple shopping list SPA where you can add items, strike out items or remove them if not required from your cart and above all it keeps a count of the quantity of items you have placed and it will calculate it accordingly even if you remove, add or strike out a particular item.

1. clone this repo
2. cd Simple-Shopping-List
3. npm install
4. npm start

And try out every possible situation and I would be happy if you found any bugs.
Thank you. Enjoy.
